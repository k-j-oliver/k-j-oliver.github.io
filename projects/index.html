  <h3>Thesis <i>current</i></h3>
  <p>My thesis uses Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's assemblage theory to explore how the production of technology complicates the library’s values as outlined by the American Library Association (ALA). I explore how accessibility to information is increasingly mediated through technology alongside questions of who technology is built for, who benefits, and who is making the decisions. I also consider the ALA’s commitment to social responsibility, and recently, sustainability, and ask how does the accelerating integration of technology into the library space confront these values when we recognize the role played by technology’s production in environmental and social hazards. This thesis brings the library into the timely discussion of climate change and critical tech ethics.</p>
  
  <h3>Stormlight Archive Scraper <i>2018></i></h3>
  <p>This project was an advanced look at object-oriented PHP, JSON, and JavaScript. I built a scraper to collect the biographical data from each character page in <a href="http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters"  target="_blank">this Wikia</a> created for <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>, a fantasy series by Brandon Sanderson. I collected data from over 200 pages and filled multiple MySQL tables for querying. Then, I encoded the results in JSON for visualization with bar charts from the D3 library.<br><br>

  <h3>Table Top Gamers <i>2017</i></h3>
  <p>This project was my introduction to HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL databases. The purpose was to create something from scratch that would complete the cycle of receiving, saving, retrieving, and showing user input. This project allowed users to make an account with an avatar, add a game to the database, and rate a game with their play experience. The retrieval would show all games in the database, user responses, and sort the top 3 rated games based on this input.<br><br>
While the website is no longer linked to the database and functional, you can still view the bones of it here: <a href="http://hucodev.srv.ualberta.ca/oliver2/index.php" target="_blank">Table Top Gamers</a>. The HTML, CSS, and MySQL code will be uploaded soon.</p>
