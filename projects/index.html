  <h2>Table Top Gamers</h2>
  <p>This project was my introduction to HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL databases. The purpose was to create something from scratch that would complete the cycle of receiving, saving, retrieving, and showing user input. This project allowed users to make an account with an avatar, add a game to the database, and rate a game with their play experience. The retrieval would show all games in the database, user responses, and sort the top 3 rated games based on this input.<br><br>
While the website is no longer linked to the database and functional, you can still view the bones of it here: <a href="http://hucodev.srv.ualberta.ca/oliver2/index.php" target="_blank">Table Top Gamers</a>. The HTML, CSS, and MySQL code will be uploaded soon.</p>

  <h2>Stormlight Archive Scraper</h2>
  <p>This project was an advanced look at object-oriented PHP, JSON, and JavaScript. I built a scraper to collect the biographical data from each character page in <a href="http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters"  target="_blank">this Wikia</a> created for _The Stormlight Archive_, a fantasy series by Brandon Sanderson. I collected data from over 200 pages and filled multiple MySQL tables for querying. Then, I encoded the results in JSON for visualization with bar charts from the D3 library.<br><br>
You can find a more detailed explanation and the repository here: <a href="https://k-j-oliver.github.io/StormlightArchiveScraper/"  target="_blank">Stormlight Archive Scraper</a>.</p>
