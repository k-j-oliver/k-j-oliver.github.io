        <h3>Go Queer</h3>
        <p>This project built a locative mobile application that encourages players to experience the city queerly. While walking around, the app will notify you when you've come across a place of queer history. You can then go through our curated gallery of photographs, videos, or sound recordings to experience the story while standing in that same physical space. A discovery might prompt you to explore more, to consider where else this history exists, or how else you can queerly move through the streets. Dr. Maureen Engel lead this project out of the University of Alberta. My task was to research Edmonton's queer history and collect narratives and media items to build our galleries. The challenge was that queer history runs counter to the main narrative and is by large an oral history passed down through experience and story. Traditional sources were not always the best because the perspective was often from outside the community and mis-representative or negligent in details. Luckily, Edmonton has many vocal members and initiatives from the queer community that have captured and retold these stories for the public. Since the research was conducted by myself and another RA, we needed to establish a productive collaborative workflow that clearly and accurately tracked media sources for appropriate citation and attribution. There are now 71 events and locations in the app.<br><br>
          At the project's close, I contributed to wrapping up loose ends and thinking through how a digital project should be archived. Where was the essence of the project? I ensured all media items were clearly attributed when necessary, wrote a procedures document, made screenshots of all content as it appears in the app, and wrote a legacy document detailing the file organization, intention of the project, and reflection on its outcomes.<br><br>
          Below is a link to the app and an interview I did with SHOUT for libraries:

        <h3>Algoma University's Archive</h3>
        <p>The majority of the Algoma University Archives holds the Algoma Anglican Diocese files which includes parish records. A small number of parishes had historical biographies in the online catalogue, which users had found useful for their research. When I wasn't processing new acquisitions, I contributed to completion of historical biographies for all of the churches and parishes for which we had records. While doing so, I also pulled high quality documents and photographs to scan and upload for improved user access to our material. Many of these historical documents were not clearly labelled in our online catalogue, only being a few pages of scribbles in a logbook. I would check our catalogue for these logbooks to narrow my search, tracking my progress with a Google Sheet shared with my supervisor. By the end of my internship, I had completed the historical biographies in our collection and attached relevant scanned documents and photographs for our users to quickly access. Some examples of my work can be found at these pages:

      <h3>George Whalley Project</h3>
      <p>George Whalley was a Canadian scholar and poet. He focused his prose on the study of Samuel Taylor Coleridge while also producing essays like "Picking up the Thread" (1973)--an exploration of the English discipline in the university landscape--or "Literary Computing" (1967) which discussed the value in future partnership between literary studies and computing power. His poetry was drawn from his experiences as a naval officer and secret intelligence agent during WWII, moving into self-reflection as he aged. The George Whalley Project, lead by Dr. Michael DiSanto at Algoma University and in partnership with Queen's University, sought to collect the immense amount of material written by Whalley. I transcribed, scanned, maintained consistency, and uploaded hundreds of George Whalley's manuscripts: from letters to editors, family, and colleagues to drafts of poetry written on napkins and backs of envelopes. While transcribing material, I also contributed to a large-scale timeline of Whalley's life spanning 50 years. We wanted to track where Whalley was, what he was writing about, and who he was in conversations with.<br><br>
        Much of this material is kept in a private repository, however, there is a significant publication of Whalley's life, scholarship, and poetic work. As well, a digital edition of selected poetry is available to the public. Users can look between manuscript drafts of poetry and compare with a dual panel interface. These websites are available through this portal: <a href="http://georgewhalley.ca/gwps/" target="_blank">georgewhalley.ca</a>.<br><br>
      Within this assistantship, I also contributed to the copyeditting for <i>The Complete Poems of George Whalley</i> edited by Dr. Michael DiSanto, and assisted in preparing for the George Whalley conference in 2015, held at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.</p>
