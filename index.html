  <p> Hey there! Glad you stopped by.<br><br>
    I've made this little spot to show you a bit about myself and the work I do. You can look through my CV, small projects I have worked on (coding and otherwsie), and showcases of my time as a research assistant.</p>
  <h3>A bit about myself</h3>
  <p>I'm from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, a small and beautiful city sitting on the river rapids that connect Lake Superior and Lake Huron. The rapids were the namesake for the area's original Ojibwa name, Baawitigong, sometimes also called Bawating. The area is surrounded by deep forest, expansive water, and provincial parks with no shortage of places to explore. At the same time, it is a city dependent on the steel industry and the only path through the Great Lakes, bringing steady freight traffic on the river. The area was colonized early and two residential schools were built, Shingwauk and Wawanosh. The Shingwauk building became Algoma University where I recieved my BA in English with a minor in History. The university is a unique space because of its history. It houses Algoma's Anglican Diocense records including much material from the frontier years, while a cemetery of unmarked Indigenous graves sits behind the building, and the Shingwauk Kinoomaage Gamig teaching lodge on campus, soon to be moved across the road to the Anishinaabek Discovery Centre. I was lucky enough to work in the University's archives alongside the archivist, curator, and researcher for the Shingwauk Residential School Centre--a grass-roots community archive. Here, I was exposed to how these facets of history reconcile in physical space.<br><br>
  One day, I saw the poster for the MLIS degree at the University of Alberta hanging in the office. I applied and was accepted to the combined MA/MLIS program in 2017 and am now living happily in Edmonton. I'm entering my final year of coursework with my thesis slated to be finished in Fall 2020. The program has introduced me to so many new ideas; I continue to enjoy creating through code and exploring my research interests in digital privacy, the free/libre and open source software movements, Wikipedia, and Indigenous and/or decolonial theory and praxis. I am always eager to hear about efforts of radical librarianship leveraging their unique position at the intersection of our social, political, educational, and economical worlds to create change.</p>
