  <h1>Kathleen Oliver</h1>
  <h2>Candidate for the combined MA/MLIS degree in Digital Humanities at the University of Alberta</h2>
  <p>I am entering my final year of coursework with continuing thesis work slated to be done by Fall 2020. My thesis uses assemblage theory to explore how the production of technology fits in or frustrates the library’s values as outlined by the American Library Association (ALA). I explore how accessibility to information is increasingly mediated through technology alongside questions of who technology is built for, who benefits, and who is making the decisions. I also consider the ALA’s commitment to social responsibility, and recently, sustainability, and ask how does the accelerating integration of technology into the library space confront these values when we recognize the physical production of technology’s role in environmental and social hazards. This thesis brings the library into the timely discussion of climate change and critical tech ethics.<br><br>

Beyond this, my interests include digital privacy, the free/libre and open source software movements, Wikipedia, and Indigenous and/or decolonial theory and praxis. I am always eager to learn about hopeful efforts of radical or progressive librarianship aimed at changing our social world. I am also deeply satisfied by creating through code, paint, ink, food, soil, words, and on. Finally, I am an avid hiker, nature enthusiast, and tabletop gamer!</p>
