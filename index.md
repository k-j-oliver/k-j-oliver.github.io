### Stormlight Archive Scraper
This scraper collects biographical data from each character entry in this fan-made wikia page: [Stormlight Archive Wikia](http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters). The data is entered into multiple MySQL tables. The tables are queried, the results put into JSON, then visualized with bar charts.
