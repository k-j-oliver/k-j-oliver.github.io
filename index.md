## Stormlight Archive Scraper
This scraper collects biographical data from each character entry in this fan-made wikia page: [Stormlight Archive Wikia](http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters). The data is entered into multiple MySQL tables; first as single entity tables, then with another script, the relationship tables are built. The tables are queried, the results put into JSON, then visualized with bar charts.

You can find the GitHub page and demonstration here: [Stormlight Archive Scraper](https://k-j-oliver.github.io/StormlightArchiveScraper/)
