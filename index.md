### Stormlight Archive Scraper
 _The Stormlight Archive_ is a fantasy series by Brandon Sanderson, and [this wikia](http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters) is a user-generated record of the many characters and their fantastical biographies. This scraper collects biographical data from each character entry, enters the data into multiple MySQL tables for querying,  and then encodes the results in JSON for visualization with bar charts.
