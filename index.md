### Stormlight Archive Scraper
This scraper collects biographical data from each character entry in this fan-made wikia page: [Stormlight Archive Wikia](http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters). The data is entered into multiple MySQL tables, then queried and the results put into JSON for visualization with bar charts.
