## About me
I am entering my final year of coursework with continuing thesis work slated to be done by Fall 2020. My thesis uses assemblage theory to explore how the production of technology fits in or frustrates the library’s values as outlined by the American Library Association (ALA). I explore how accessibility to information is increasingly mediated through technology alongside questions of who technology is built for, who benefits, and who decides. I also consider the ALA’s commitment to social responsibility, and recently, sustainability, and ask how does the integration of technology into the library space frustrate this value when we consider the physical production of technology’s role in environmental and social hazards. This thesis brings the library into the timely discussion of climate change and critical tech ethics. 

Beyond this, my interests include digital privacy, the free/libre and open source software movements, Wikipedia, and Indigenous and/or decolonial theory and praxis. I am always eager to learn about efforts and hopes for radical or progressive librarianship. I am also deeply satisfied by creating through code, paint, ink, food, soil, words, and on. Finally, I am an avid hiker, nature enthusiast, and tabletop gamer.

## Personal Projects

### Table Top Gamers
This project was my introduction to HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL databases. The purpose was to create something from scratch that would complete the cycle of receiving, saving, retrieving, and showing user input. This project allowed users to make an account with an avatar, rate a game with their play experience, and input a game to the repository. The retrieval would show all of the user's responses, games in the database, and sort the top 3 rated games based on all user input. 

You can view the website here: [Table Top Gamers](http://hucodev.srv.ualberta.ca/oliver2/index.php). However, the database is no longer linked. The HTML, CSS, and MYSQL code will be uploaded soon. 

### Stormlight Archive Scraper
 This project was an advanced look at object-oriented PHP, JSON, and JavaScript. I built a scraper to collect the biographical data from each character page in [this Wikia](http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters) created for _The Stormlight Archive_, a fantasy series by Brandon Sanderson. I collect data from over 200 pages and fill multiple MySQL tables for querying. Then, I encode the results in JSON for visualization with bar charts from the D3 library.
